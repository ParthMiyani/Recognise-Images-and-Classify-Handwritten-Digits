# Recognise-Images-and-Classify-Handwritten-Digits

### Neural Network with keras

In this notebook, I use Keras library to get database and serval models from Keras to train code. It recognizes ten different types of images.

### Neural Network

In this, I build a neural network without the Keras. I use TensorFlow to build and keep track of the model. It classifies the handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and predicts the right number with 97.78% accuracy.
