# Recognise-Images-and-Classify-Handwritten-Digits

### Neural Network with keras

In this notebook, I use keras library to get database and serval models from kears to train code. It recognize in ten different types of images.

### Neural Network

In this, I build neural network without the keras. I use tensorflow to build and keep track of the model. It classify the handwritten digits form 0 to 9 and predict right
number with 97.78% accuracy.
